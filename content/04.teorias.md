> Eventually, the system will survive long enough to pass on its own copy of the digitalized memory (or part of it) to a new generation; this corresponds to a back-translation of the message to the digitalform.
> But this latter process takes on its true significance only when seen at the level of the population.
> For it is the population (rather than the single organism) that passes on messages about conditions of life to the memory of the collective (the gene pool).
> The population could in this sense be considered a codification that itself expresses a message.
> This codification, however, is necessarily analog---since it has to interact with the physical surroundings, and thus must share with these surroundings the properties of physical extension and contiguity. (Hoffmeyer, 2008, p. 103)
